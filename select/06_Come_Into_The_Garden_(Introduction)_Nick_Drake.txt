Nick Drake
Family Tree
Come In To The Garden
In the bright red sky
In the heat of an evening
When only prisoners sleep
She said she couldn't
Come to the garden
See an old man weep

She said her dreams
What too far to be thought of
As scars too WIDE to view
She said she couldn't
Come to the garden
See a blind man kneel

She sailed away
To a blue horizon
In floating thoughts she'd sway
She said she couldn't
Come to the garden
See an old man pray

She wished them luck
As they left on their journey
Maybe she'd join them soon
But she lost her grip
At the tip of life's finger
Went home and worshipped the moon
